# `dotfiles`

`NAlexPear`'s collection of dotfiles for daily use.

## Usage

To symlink these files to the proper locations, use `link.sh`.

X-based linux distros with `systemd` are assumed, and no dependency resolution is attempted. You will probably want to install the following for the best experience:

`bat`
`cargo`
`fd`
`fzf`
`i3-gaps`
`kitty`
`nvim`
`playerctl`
`picom`
`ttf-iosevka`
`ttf-iosevka-term`
`z`
